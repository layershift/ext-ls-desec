## What information we collect, use, and why

The extension only shares the API token with the deSEC service (operated independently by deSEC e.V. under the terms of your direct agreement and relationship with them) itself, for the purpose of authenticating its API requests during its operation.

We collect or use the following information for **dealing with queries and bug reports about the extension**:
